00:10.390 --> 00:14.150
AI we are using is AssemblyAI. Okay this is an

amazing AI which will be create your YouTube subtitles

00:18.238 --> 00:21.846

00:21.958 --> 00:25.710

00:25.790 --> 00:29.346
I'm using two language which is global English and Hindi.

00:29.438 --> 00:32.802
Even you can add your more language as per your choice.

00:32.866 --> 00:36.874

Okay once you put the API you can click on generate and it will

00:40.482 --> 00:44.258

00:44.314 --> 00:48.162
these SRT files are called subtitles. Here you can see in download

00:48.186 --> 00:52.050
I have lot of files so you can see srt okay in english,

00:52.130 --> 00:55.546

01:02.456 --> 01:06.320
grammatical mistakes and spelling mistakes. So once you generate

01:06.360 --> 01:09.872
